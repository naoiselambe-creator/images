<!-- SECTION 1: About Me -->
<div class="full-width">
  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>During my fourth-year placement (EDU410) with a Junior Infant class, one language lesson that best demonstrated my commitment to planning and preparation was an English oral language lesson focused on procedural language. The lesson centred on the procedure of making homemade Play-Doh. I selected this lesson for the portfolio because it represents a moment where careful planning, inclusive practice, intentional pedagogical choices and playfulness, created meaningful learning experiences for a very diverse group of learners.</p>
